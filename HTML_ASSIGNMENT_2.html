		<h1>Patrick Young</h1>
		<p>
			I am a lecturer in the Stanford Computer Science Department.
			Before coming to Stanford, I spent two years as a programmer at Taligent
			(now part of IBM). At Taligent, I worked on Places for Project Teams, a
			groupware product designed to improve communication and coordination within
			small project teams. I was fortunate to work with the Places for Project
			Teams product throughout an entire software lifecycle from initial product
			conception through the actual product launch.<BR><BR> I have a Ph D. from the
			University of California, Irvine, where I specialized in Software Engineering.
			My dissertation was on process support for software engineering teams.
			I also have a masters degree from Irvine, with a specialization in Artificial
			Intelligence,and bachelors degrees in Computer Science and Electrical
			Engineering.
